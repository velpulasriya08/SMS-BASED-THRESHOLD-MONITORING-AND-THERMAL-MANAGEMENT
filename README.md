# SMS-BASED-THRESHOLD-MONITORING-AND-THERMAL-MANAGEMENT
SMS based threshold monitoring lets the operators track remote equipment like generators by sending alerts if parameters exceed set limits.operators can adjust thresholds via SMS,ensuring safety and uptime even in areas without internet,but with mobile coverage.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a smart monitoring and control system designed to track temperature and other critical parameters in real-time. When the values exceed a defined threshold, it automatically sends SMS alerts and activates a thermal management response, such as turning on a fan or cooling system.

Itâ€™s especially useful for applications where overheating can damage equipment or cause safety hazardsâ€”like in server rooms, electrical panels, or industrial machinery.

ðŸ”„ HOW IT WORKS â€“ Key Points

TEMPERATURE SENSOR READS ENVIRONMENT:
A sensor like LM35 or DHT11 continuosly measures the temperature.

MICROCONTROLLER MONITORS THE DATA:
A microcontroller checks the sensor readings at regular intervals.

THRESHOLD COMPARISON:
The system compares the current temperature with a predefined threshold value.

SENDS SMS IF LIMIT IS CROSSED:
If the temperature exceeds the threshold ,the GSM module sends an SMS alert to a saved mobile number.

SYSTEM KEEPS MONITIORING:
The temperature keeps being monitored. If it falls back below the threshold, the fan is turned OFF automatically.
