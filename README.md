# SMS-BASED-THRESHOLD-MONITORING-AND-THERMAL-MANAGEMENT
SMS based threshold monitoring lets the operators track remote equipment like generators by sending alerts if parameters exceed set limits.operators can adjust thresholds via SMS,ensuring safety and uptime even in areas without internet,but with mobile coverage.
ðŸ”§ Project Overview

This project is a smart monitoring and control system designed to track temperature and other critical parameters in real-time. When the values exceed a defined threshold, it automatically sends SMS alerts and activates a thermal management response, such as turning on a fan or cooling system.

Itâ€™s especially useful for applications where overheating can damage equipment or cause safety hazardsâ€”like in server rooms, electrical panels, or industrial machinery.
